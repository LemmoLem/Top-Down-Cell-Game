# Top-Down-Cell-Game
Project done for graphics coursework 
A top down cell game with self drawn textures
This project uses openGL and the final result is an agario like game
There is basic implemented enemy ai
With cells of varied random shape and sizes 
Aggressive cells chase the player and can kill the player
Theres cells which flee from the player which the player needs to touch to gain points
Some cells follow pattern movement and can neither be killed or kill
This is to implement collisions in the game
